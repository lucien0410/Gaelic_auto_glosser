## Prerequisite:
	I assumed that *python* and *NLTK* are already installed.  
	
# Usage
## Step 1: Replace incorrect apostrophes with "'"
	In your command line, enter:
		"python correct_Apostrophe.py FILE_NAME"
	For example:
	 	"python correct_Apostrophe.py Demo_Galic.txt"
	This step will yield a new file called "mod_FILE_NAME"; 
	For the current example, we will have "mod_Demo_Gaelic.txt"

## Step 2: Train the glosser and auto-gloss
	In your command line, enter:
		"python auto_gloss.py mod_FILE_NAME"
	For example:
		"python auto_gloss.py mod_Christine_Primrose_Portugal.txt"
	This step will yield a new file called "gloss_lines_of_FILE_NAME"; 
	For the current example, we will have "gloss_lines_of_mod_Christine_Primrose_Portugal.txt"  

## Step 3: Combine the original file and the gloss lines file
	In your command line, enter:
		"python interlinearize.py FILE_NAME gloss_lines_of_FILE_NAME"
	For example:
		"python interlinearize.py mod_Christine_Primrose_Portugal.txt gloss_lines_of_mod_Christine_Primrose_Portugal.txt" 
	This step will yield a new file called "auto_glossed_FILE_NAME"; 
	For the current example, we will have "auto_glossed_mod_Christine_Primrose_Portugal.txt"
